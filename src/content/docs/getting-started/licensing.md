Simple Likes is a paid Statamic addon.

Maintaining and supporting it takes time and effort, so payment helps ensure continued development and support.

## Pricing

- **New licence:** $30
- **Annual renewal:** $15/year for support & updates

You can use Simple Likes for free while in development. You only need to purchase a licence when your site goes live.

Licences can be purchased from the [Statamic Marketplace](https://statamic.com/addons/graffio/simple-likes).

## Version Guarantee

Any version released within your licence period can be used indefinitely, even after your licence expires. You'll only need to renew if you want access to newer versions and continued support.

## Statamic 6 Upgrade

If you purchased Simple Likes before Statamic 6, a free upgrade will be provided to ensure compatibility with the new version.

## Free During Development

Simple Likes works without a licence key in local development environments. You only need to purchase a licence when deploying to a production server.
